## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Components Implemented

### 1. Cloud Scheduler Automation
```hcl
# Daily ETL Execution at 4:30 AM EST
resource "google_cloud_scheduler_job" "daily_etl" {
  schedule         = "30 4 * * *"
  time_zone        = "America/New_York"
  retry_config {
    retry_count          = 3
    max_retry_duration   = "3600s"
    max_backoff_duration = "600s"
    min_backoff_duration = "30s"
    max_doublings        = 4
  }
}

# Weekly Comprehensive Validation - Mondays 5:00 AM
resource "google_cloud_scheduler_job" "weekly_validation" {
  schedule = "0 5 * * 1"
  # Advanced retry logic with exponential backoff
}
```

**Features:**
