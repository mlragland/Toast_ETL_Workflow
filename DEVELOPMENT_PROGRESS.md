## üìà Progress Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Weeks 1-2 | Duration: 2 weeks | Status: 100% Complete**

**Major Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ **Modular Architecture**: Converted 643-line monolithic script ‚Üí 11 focused Python modules
- ‚úÖ **Configuration System**: Environment-based config with settings.py + file-specific transformations
- ‚úÖ **Production Logging**: Cloud + console logging with structured output
- ‚úÖ **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for network operations
- ‚úÖ **SFTP Extraction**: Production-ready with connection validation + error handling
- ‚úÖ **Base Framework**: Transformer and main CLI entry point
- ‚úÖ **Unit Testing**: 9 tests with 100% pass rate
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README + requirements
- ‚úÖ **Version Control**: Git repository with proper .gitignore
- ‚úÖ **Live Testing**: Successfully extracted 7 CSV files (73KB) from Toast SFTP
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Deployment**: Public repository at https://github.com/mlragland/Toast_ETL_Workflow.git

**Technical Deliverables:**
- Complete project structure with src/ directory organization
- SFTP extractor with retry logic and SSH validation
- Settings management with environment variables
- Logging utilities with cloud integration capabilities
- Base transformer framework ready for Phase 2 implementation
- CLI entry point with phase-specific execution options

### Phase 2: Infrastructure & Containerization ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Weeks 2-3 | Duration: 1 week | Status: 100% Complete**

**Major Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ **Containerization**: Multi-stage Dockerfile with optimized builds, security, and health checks
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Cloud Build configuration with automated testing and security scanning
- ‚úÖ **BigQuery Integration**: Native Python BigQuery loader replacing bash script dependency
  - 7 table schemas defined with partitioning and clustering
  - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
  - Data validation and quality checks
  - Metadata tracking (loaded_at, source_file)
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete Terraform configuration
  - GCP resource provisioning (BigQuery, Storage, Pub/Sub, IAM)
  - Service account management with least privilege access
  - Environment-specific variable management
- ‚úÖ **Build Optimization**: .dockerignore for efficient builds
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Phase 2 unit tests with mocked BigQuery operations

**Technical Deliverables:**
- BigQuery loader with native Python client (replaces bash scripts)
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Cloud Build pipeline with automated testing
- Terraform IaC for complete GCP infrastructure
- Service account and IAM configuration
- Storage buckets with lifecycle management
- Pub/Sub topics for notifications

**Live Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ BigQuery loader successfully connects and creates dataset
- ‚úÖ Successfully loaded 3/7 files (CheckDetails, KitchenTimings, CashEntries)
- üîÑ **Next Phase Required**: 4 files failed due to special characters in column names
  - AllItemsReport.csv: "Item Qty (incl voids)" - parentheses not allowed
  - PaymentDetails.csv: "V/MC/D Fees" - slashes not allowed  
  - OrderDetails.csv: "Duration (Opened to Paid)" - parentheses not allowed
  - ItemSelectionDetails.csv: "Menu Subgroup(s)" - parentheses not allowed

**Phase 2 Summary:**
Infrastructure and containerization foundation complete. BigQuery integration working but revealed need for transformation layer to handle column name sanitization - exactly what Phase 3 will address.

---

### Phase 3: Automation & Orchestration üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Weeks 3-4 | Duration: 1 week | Status: 0% Complete**

**Planned Achievements:**
- **Column Name Sanitization**: Transform special characters in CSV headers
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Implement data transformation pipeline
- **Scheduling**: Cloud Scheduler for daily 4:30 AM execution
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Pub/Sub triggers for real-time processing
- **Monitoring Setup**: Cloud Monitoring dashboards and alerting

## üéØ Current Status

**‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete**: Modular foundation with SFTP extraction working in production  
**‚úÖ Phase 2 Complete**: Infrastructure and containerization with BigQuery integration  
**üîÑ Phase 3 Starting**: Need transformation layer for column name sanitization  

**Ready for Production**: Extraction and basic loading capabilities  
**Next Priority**: Column name transformation to handle all Toast CSV formats  

**Project Health**: üü¢ **On Track** - Ahead of schedule, all core components operational
